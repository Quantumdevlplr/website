Initially, for children under 10, the platform will use AI to create interactive games, puzzles, and quizzes, making learning engaging and effective. For adolescents aged 10-20, the focus shifts to gaming-based learning, incorporating general knowledge and subject-specific content to improve productivity and analytical skills. For young adults aged 20-30, the platform will emphasize industrial knowledge and social skills development to prepare them for real-world scenarios. The startup will operate on a SaaS and freemium model, with five phases of expansion: starting with basic games and AI-driven customization, then expanding to state, national, and international levels, progressively adding features and integrating AR/VR technology. The goal is to revolutionize education by making it enjoyable and relevant for all ages.',
